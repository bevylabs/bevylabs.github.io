    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We may collect basic device information to ensure compatibility and improve app performance. This might include device model, operating system version and other technical data required for app functionality.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not collect any other personal information such as names, email addresses, or location data.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information collected for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>

    </ul>

    <hr>
